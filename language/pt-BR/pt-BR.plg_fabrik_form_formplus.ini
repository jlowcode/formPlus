PLG_FORM_FORMPLUS_ELEMENT_MAP_DESC="An object represented as a json string.  Takes the 'from' field as the key and the 'to' field as that value _txss-
e.g. {&quot;acts___name&quot;:&quot;events___title&quot;,&quot;acts___bio&quot;:&quot;events___description&quot;}
Looks up artist, and puts the artist name in the events title, and the artist bio and puts it in the forms 'events___description' field.

To map a single 'from' to multiple 'to' elements, use an array from the 'to' value, like [&quot;table___field1&quot;,&quot;table___field2&quot;]

Join records are now mapped with the full name(previously you had to append the full element name wth 'join__X____', and whilst this will still work it is no longer necessary
